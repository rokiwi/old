Exit the assembly-line work in a vineyard, we re-tool in "artistic horticulture"... In our new wwoofing, we prune pear, apple and hazelnut trees but each tree is an art work in itself. The artist often steps back to have a wider view of his work and then adapts his cuttings... From one vine per minute, we're now almost at one tree per hour (only the big ones)...

Our hosts, Alastair (math and physics teacher) and Jane (real estate agent) come from UK and traveled a bit before settling in Hastings. At 11am everyday, we're having tea with Trevor and Christine, Alastair's parents, who live also on the property. It's time to eat a few biscuits baked with love and to put the world to rights with these two lovely retired Scottish, passionate about traditional Scottish dance and songs...

All the bay seems to be in art-Deco style, with a touch of Maori culture. This architectural style goes back to the '30 when Hastings and its neighbour Napier were reconstructed after a devastating earthquake. We'll find more about Maori culture in going up the East coast which is more linked to its Maori roots and traditions.
