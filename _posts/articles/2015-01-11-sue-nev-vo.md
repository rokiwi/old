First kiwi stop: Sue and Nev's woofing. Such a lovely place! A river, an orchard, a large vege garden, a Mini Cooper, a few cows, some chooks and their chickens, a lonesome duck and sheep of course (we're in New Zealand!)…

Thirty years ago Sue and Nev chose self sufficiency. That means water is pumped by a windmill, energy is produced by solar panels and a large part of their daily food is provided by their garden, their orchard or their cattle (milk, yogurt, cheese, meat). Their ‘trick’ to harvest enough without using chemical input is permaculture. Their favourite are potatoes, apples and tomatoes, they grow many different varieties and make cross breeding to create new ones.

Our job is never boring, it's changing all the time: weeding (don't go wwoofing if you don't like weeding ;)), splitting firewood, cutting the Christmas tree, bringing the cows back home in the evening, sorting the sheep, collecting seaweed from the beach and spreading it as fertiliser on the garden, picking raspberries, peas, artichokes, … and helping to cook it, watering thirsty trees, … 
Well time is flying, we could have spent one year in this little paradise but the rest of New Zealand is waiting for us! Never mind, we might come back… :)
