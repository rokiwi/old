Our first attempt to reach the crater in a standard car is a failure, the car was far too low... The next day, we're more prepared! We hire a so-called 4WD, the sticker 4WD was on the car but not the propelling mechanism. In the end, we got up the crater after a sporty drive on an uneven and steep track.

This track is "maintained" by a quite original chap: Da Crater Man. This kind of hermit lives almost in the crater and carefully records the country of every visitor. To date, more than 200 nationalities visited "his" crater and quoting him : " I don't go anywhere, the world is coming to me ". Except his cranky keeper, the crater isn't that special because vegetation is now covering all the slopes. You still have to be careful: if you fall, there will be no rescue!
