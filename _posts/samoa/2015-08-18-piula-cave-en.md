Samoan culture is very Christian so we visit a few churches, or the natural pools next those churches instead. Piula is a Methodist Church and there's a pool carved into the rock. The water is so pure that you can see the fish swimming. The pool is also going into a cave, if you want to swim in the shade ;).

Our second stop is a waterfall located behind a Mormon church. The pool at the bottom of the waterfall is quite deep so you can practise your jump skills. If you don't move for a while, little fish come to massage/tickle you. We had this lovely paddle day thanks to Ren√©e! :)
