A blowhole is a sink in a cliff next to the sea. When a huge wave comes, pressure is built in the narrow sink and water is blown outside in fine drops. When you throw a coconut in a blow-hole and there's a powerful wave, your coconut flies in the air. It's very funny! ;)

A last stop before bringing the rental car back: Tafua peninsula. We try not to get lost in the 100 metres of jungle between the road and another volcanic crater. Then, on the beach, we have a closer look at all the little shells and corals on the beach. We wanted to bring a few back but New Zealand takes very seriously the trade of endangered species and we have to leave our little pieces of dead corals at Auckland customs.
