If you're looking for something on Savaii, that's where you're very likely to find it. We bought there flip-flops, lava-lava, a recycled doormat, a SIM card, Samoan peanuts, chicken fritters, taro cooked with coconut cream, a bunch of bananas, a large wooden spoon.

It's also a meeting place with pool tables and Checkers. By the way, we met there Joelan, his wife and Ricardo. Jenn went for some shopping with her and we stayed to try 'kava' with the men. Kava is a drink resulting from the soaking of kava roots, it's drunk in a halved coconut shell and it numbs slightly your lips. It's supposed to intoxicate you like alcohol (except from going to pee we didn't feel it) and you have to drink it bottom up.
