Red leather inside the car and a horse with blue wings on the bonnet of the cab that drives us from the wharf to Maota-o-Ma'a Beach Fale in Tafatafa. After a drive of one and a half hour, we arrive at our personal resort: we're the only guests! Alaimoana and his wife Lise kindly welcome us: our well-being is their main concern, they're really worried they don't feed us enough (they virtually stuff us!) and they're really proud of their local customs. Olivier received a traditional birthday barbecue for his 25th and a wonderful cocoa-coconut cake. 

Before we leave for a day walk, we receive a coconut instead of a bottle of water: coconut water is rich with minerals and, once you drank the liquid, you can open the nut and eat the creamy inside for extra energy.

Advertising for people who would like to go to Samoa or for people who know people who would like to go to Samoa: you should really go to Maota-o-Ma'a Beach Fale because there's an amazingly warm welcome, you feel like you're part of the family, it's really quiet and clean, the food is sooo good and traditional,... It's really the best!!
