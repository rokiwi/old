They are all different but it's easy to spot them. They are 'noisy as' with their engine running, their music playing or their honk used as a means of expression. They are as colourful as the fish and the driver may be sitting on the left or on the right (to get economically closer to NZ, the government took the decision in 2009 to drive on the left side instead of the right side, but some vehicles aren't up to date). Sometimes they don't even stop because they are to full ... It's the best way to join the crowd.
