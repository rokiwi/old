Or why the hell is this article published so late...

We want an interactive map: a challenge for the geek of the trip. And we also want small icons on which you can click, another challenge.

We are three for this trip with four devices that can take pictures: our little camera, Jenn's smartphone, Jenn's waterproof camera and Jenn's big camera (she's Asian ;) ). It means loads of pictures to sort! We sent a memory stick to Jenn in Amberley (South Island) and she sent it back to us, full of pictures and, as extra, sweets and biscuits from Taiwan.

Finally, close to the end, we unfortunately drop the tablet on the wrong side and the repairs are taking two more weeks. Besides this article was written on paper before being published :).

So that's the story behind the story... ;)
