The vehicle we were driving to go to this Waterfall was quite special: a mini-bus with 15 seats for the three of us only. How did we get there? It's a long story... Do you remember the car we hired (the 4WD which actually wasn't one)? The police stopped us to indicate us the insurance wasn't up-to-date, we don't get fined but we have to go back straight away to the hiring company to sort this "detail" out. Actually, it's only a problem of sticker which should arrive in the 2 o'clock ferry (this sounds a bit funny doesn't it?!). In the meantime, we can use the only vehicle available, a 15 seats bus.

Around 3pm, we're back with the bus. The sticker isn't there yet but maybe it will be in the 4 o'clock ferry? Well it won't! There's a document in the glove box to show that the car had got insurance. Why didn't they tell us that earlier?! After a check, there's is a document in the glove box but it involves a car with a different brand, model and colour. According to the rental company, it's not a big deal and, if the police catches us again, we should bring the cops to the office and they will settle the problem amicably because they're good friends... Anyway, we rented a car.
