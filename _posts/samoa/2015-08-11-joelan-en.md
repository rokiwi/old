We unpack our bags in our first fale (little hut on the beach) : Joelan. The beach, the coconut tree, as many bananas as you want, we are delighted. Thanks to Ricardo knowledge (the Australian trauma surgeon, cousin to some degree to the family in charge of the fale), we dive without fear along the coral reef (Nemo would be jealous of it). Jenn got stunk by a jellyfish but hopefully doctor Ricardo is around (he is never very far) and squeeze a lemon on the wound to neutralise the venom.

Amongst the other permanent residents, there are two cats and four dogs. We fall asleep (and sometimes we don't) lulled by the sound of the waves which break right under our fale. We never miss the opportunity to loosen a coconut (and then have it open of course).
