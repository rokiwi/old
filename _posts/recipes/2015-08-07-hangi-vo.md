It takes about 2h for the fire to burn down. From time to time check that the stack stays vertical to make sure the stones fall into the hole.

Now that it's burning, soak the jute cloths in water. The fabric must be completely wet. Dress the basket : eatable leaves at the bottom (cabbage, leek, banana or breadfruit depending where you are in the world) and stuffed meat (with garlic and rosemary). Chop the potatoes into large chunks and wrap it in a mutton cloth. Put it on the top of the basket.

Remove the unburned logs and part of the ambers. Rearrange the stones on top of the ambers to make a nice platform for the basket.

Put the basket on the hot stones and pour a bowl of water to wet the food. Act quickly now while laying the jute cloths to cover the basket then cover the all thing with soil starting with the edges. There should be no steam coming out of the heap.

After 2h of cooking, you can dig out your dinner carefully. Dig in mate !
