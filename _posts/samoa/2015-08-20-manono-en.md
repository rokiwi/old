Alaimoana and Lise drive us personally to the wharf for Manono Island. It's the third biggest island in Samoa but it's much smaller than Savaii and Upolu. Within two hours you can walk all around the island. Here, no cars, no dogs and no roaming cattle and pigs, they need to be in a pen or tied.

After a good night of sleep (already the last one in Samoa, snif), a shell-horn blows: it's breakfast time. Then traditional show off weaving and starting a fire without matches or lighter.

To complete of trip on Manono, we go on a guided walk to the top of the island. On our way, we try fresh cocoa beans (it doesn't taste like chocolate but it's still yummy!) and coconuts at different stages of ripening. We also spot huge day bats and we listen to local legends like the man who had 99 wives and got killed looking for the hundredth (too much is too much! :p).
