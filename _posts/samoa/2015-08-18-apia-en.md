All roads lead to Apia, the capital! We were supposed to go to Apia by bus but it was so fully packed with kids going to school that it didn't stop... Hopefully a local offered us a ride by the longest way, going through almost half of Upolu (he had business to do). We're not in hurry and we'll arrive when we arrive (Samoan saying).

We are going in Apia to meet Ren√©e, the very nice friend of Jenn. She's half-kiwi, half-samoan and works as a vet on Upolu. She shows us every single corner of the capital: flea market, fruit market (everything it's local of course: mangoes, star fruits, vi, cocoa and many more), pizzeria, yacht club restaurant (we wouldn't be able to afford one in Europe), coconut oil soap factory,... Well, everywhere! :)
