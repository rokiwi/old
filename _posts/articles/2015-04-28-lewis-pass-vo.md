Sue and Nev (our first wwoofing) were so friendly. Why not going back :) ? We have one week to go there : a good opportunity for a small detour through the centre of the country.

It's wet and cold, our journey in Nelson Lakes National Park is therefore relatively quick. To spice up our traditional walks, we stop in the Maruia hot springs rich in sulfur. We splash in the 38Â°C outdoor pools for 2 hours (there was a strong smell of egg due to the presence of sulfur).

Two summer in a row and we almost forget what being cold was. Heavy diggings through our backpack are required to find big pair of sock's and gloves. The inside of the chariot windows are covered with frost while we are sleeping at lake Tennyson, you got the picture ;). Fortunately the sun was there on this particular day.

Last but not the least detour (72km of gravel road) : lake Taylor and loch Katrine. We were supposed to camp along the shore of the last one but the holes in the road got the better of the chariot rocker (which is unfortunately not a 4 wheel drive). We then decided to walk to loch Katrine the next day.
